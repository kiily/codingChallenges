Given a string of angle brackets, `angles` such as `"<<><>><<<>"` write a function that adds brackets to the beggining anf end to make all angle brackets match and return it. The angle brackets "match" if for every `<` there is a corresponding `>`, and for every `>` there is a corresponding `<`.

Example input:

`><<><`

Example output:

`<><<><>>`

Explanation:

`<` was added to the beggining and `>>` was added to the end.
